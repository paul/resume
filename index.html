      <p>My passion is creating software that is a joy for fellow developers to both use and contribute to.  I am motivated to
      hone my craft of software development, to learn as much as I can about better ways to accomplish complicated tasks, and
      to build tools that are elegant, robust, and reliable.</p>

      Mountain.rb - Oct 2010<br>
      In this talk, I lament how difficult it is to build complicated nested form
      in Rails &amp; UJS. I offer a few solutions, including Form Objects. More
      recently, pure front-end apps in React or Ember have supplanted the need for
      a comprehensive solution in Rails itself.</p></li>

      MountainWest RubyConf - Mar 2010<br>
      I describe several of the more powerful features provided by the HTTP
      protocol, which are supported by most basic HTTP clients in languages&#39;
      stdlib, but not taken advantage of by most advanced client libraries.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/74-mwrc2009-writing-adapters-for-datamapper"><em>Writing Adapters for DataMapper</em></a>
      MountainWest RubyConf - Mar 2009<br>
      As a member of the core team, I gave a tutorial on how to write custom
      adapters for the DataMapper ORM. Several adapters for other databases and
      web services were contributed as a result of this talk.</p></li>

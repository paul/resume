          <p>There’s an inflection point in every startup, where you’ve got your MVP and first customers, and now
          you need to scale <em>everything</em>. You need to make the application faster while also adding features
          and fixing bugs. You need to grow the whole team, not just engineering, and build the tools to
          support them.</p>
          
          <p><strong>This is where I’m in my groove</strong>. I’ve grown teams from 3 to 100+, improved performance while
          scaling to 100x the load, and designed and built features from the ground up in an iterative and
          agile manner to minimize time-to-delivery while maximizing flexibility for future work.</p>
          
          <p>I have over 20 years of experience as a full-stack web application developer, primarily as a Rails
          developer since its inception. I also have experience with a large variety of languages, frameworks
          and technologies. I’m comfortable working at entire levels of the app stack, from CSS to SQL. I have
          the experience to know when to hack together a quick solution, or take the time to architect a
          foundation that will scale and provide a platform upon which the team can build stable features for
          years.</p>
          
          <p>I’m an active member of the Ruby community, including presenting at Rubyconf. I’ve been involved
          with major Ruby open-source development like Merb and DataMapper, and am an active contributor to
          several other projects.</p>
          
          <p>If you’re an early stage startup that has found product/market fit, and needs someone to scale both
          your product and your team, then I’d be a great choice to help you out.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Architected and implemented CRM integrations system. HouseAccount needs to reliably push and pull
                   customer data the service providers’ CRMs, which are often unreliable and not built with this
                   use-case in mind. I designed a system that allows us to re-use large amounts of logic and error
                   handling, such that integrating with a new CRM involves implementing only a few classes and
                   methods. In doing so, I reduced the implementation time for a new CRM from 6 months to 6 weeks, and
                   can be accomplished by any member on the team.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, I refactored our ViewComponents from being CRM-specific implementations to being
                   generic, so that a single Component could be used to display the different data formats from the
                   various CRMs. I leveraged several tools such as Presenters and Commands to accomplish this.</li>
                    <li>Increased the interactivity of the site using Hotwire, Turbo and Stimulus. Refactored many of our
                   Components to work more seamlessly with Turbo, and established and documented guidelines for
                   building new Components.</li>
                    <li>Coached and mentored the team in Rails and Web Development best-practices.</li>
                    <li>Worked with the COO and VP of Product to define, scope and plan projects for myself and my team.
                   Established processes between the team and product for new feature work, background chores like
                   updates and refactoring, and prioritizing bugfixes and incident management.</li>

                  <p>Joined as 3rd engineer on a team that had an existing MVP Rails application.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Drastically improved reliability of message delivery by incorporating AWS technologies API
                  Gateway, SNS &amp; SQS, and created Terraform tooling to ensure consistency between Staging and
                  Production.</li>
                    <li>Improved performance and scalability of message delivery to accommodate customer usage.</li>
                    <li>“Rescued” the existing test suite, improving runtime and reducing failure rate.</li>
                    <li>Implemented best-practices for monitoring and instrumentation, using InfluxDB and Grafana, with
                  Honeybadger for error notifications.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Once it became clear the existing application could not handle the scale we wished to achieve with
                  our new enterprise customers, I spearheaded a greenfield re-write of a replacement Rails
                  application.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>New app scaled from 1M Messages/day to over 50 Million, and 40,000 daily active users.</li>
                    <li>Expanded use of SQS for job queues to improve application reliability and scalability.</li>
                    <li>Implemented PostgreSQL best-practices: foreign key constraints, custom domains, materialized
                  views. Optimized queries, index usage, and stamping down N+1s.</li>
                    <li>Designed and built Hydra-based API for consumption by our Web UI, Mobile apps and Chrome
                  extension, as well as 3rd-party integrators. Worked closely in conjunction with frontend engineers
                  to develop an API that balanced request count with payload size. Championed use of Hypermedia for
                  the team which delivered many positive benefits.</li>
                    <li>Designed and built integration system for the reliable delivery of Webhooks and 3rd-party API
                  calls in the presence of unreliable customer and partner services.</li>
                    <li>Involved in design and implementation of every other major feature and component.</li>
                    <li>Built infrastructure for deployment, instrumentation and alerting using Heroku, Terraform,
                  InfluxDB, Grafana and Honeycomb.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>In addition to the technical work, I also performed duties as Team Lead and occasionally “Acting
                  CTO”.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Grew engineering team from 4 to 20 consisting of a diverse group of people. Streamlined
                  onboarding, performed 1on1s with the team.</li>
                    <li>I strongly believe in hiring junior engineers and continuing their education. About 1/3 of our
                  engineers were recent graduates of boot camps, often as their first engineering job. Closely
                  mentoring and providing a supportive environment is a key part of this process.</li>
                    <li>Created the technical interview process, which was used to hire most of the team. I performed most
                  of the early interviews, then trained the team to also be able to conduct interviews, and iterate on
                  the interview process.</li>
                    <li>Defined features, scoped product objectives, and collaborated with stakeholders to build a company
                  roadmap.</li>
                    <li>Instilled a culture of positivity and supportiveness, so the team felt comfortable experimenting
                  and learning from each other.</li>
                    <li>Championed and supported Agile methodologies for the team, leading standups and retros. Strong
                  advocate of introspection and continuous improvement of every aspect of building software and teams.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Service objects are an important tool in your toolbox, and Dry.rb’s Transaction library is one of
                  the most powerful, and one of the most magic. It’s a “business transaction” DSL, and has error
                  handling as a primary concern. We’ll start by exploring Monads in Ruby (they’re not scary!). Then
                  we’ll see how that simple concept unlocks another level of service objects that are far more robust
                  and testable, and how to wire them all together with Dry::Transaction. Finally we’ll touch on
                  extending transactions with custom steps, and how to integrate them into an existing application.</p>

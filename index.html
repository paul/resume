      <p>My passion is creating software that is a joy for fellow developers to both use
      and contribute to.  I am motivated to hone my craft of software development, to
      learn as much as I can about better ways to accomplish complicated projects,
      and to build tools that are elegant, robust, and reliable.</p>
      
      <p>My full-stack experiences varies from digging into the nitty gritty of kernel
      stack traces and debating the merits of various Javascript frameworks, and
      everything in between. As an engineering lead, I&#39;m also capable of recruiting
      and leading a team of fellow developers and mentoring junior engineers.</p>

      <h3 id="service-objects-with-dry.rb:-monads-and-transactions-rubyconf-denver---nov-2021"><a href="https://youtu.be/YXiqzHMmv_o">Service Objects With Dry.rb: Monads and Transactions</a> <em>RubyConf Denver - Nov 2021</em></h3>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>Service objects are an important tool in your toolbox, and Dry.rb&#39;s
      Transaction library is one of the most powerful, and one of the most magic.
      It&#39;s a &quot;business transaction&quot; DSL, and has error handling as a primary
      concern. We&#39;ll start by exploring Monads in Ruby (they&#39;re not scary!). Then
      we&#39;ll see how that simple concept unlocks another level of service objects
      that are far more robust and testable, and how to wire them all together with
      Dry::Transaction. Finally we&#39;ll touch on extending transactions with custom
      steps, and how to integrate them into an existing application.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This is a more polished version of the talk I gave at Boulder Ruby.</p>
      
      <h3 id="it-{-should-be-a_good_talk-};-writing-custom-rspec-matchers-boulder-ruby-group---jun-2020"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWdxs-fpiW0">it { should be a_good_talk }; Writing Custom RSpec Matchers</a> <em>Boulder Ruby Group - Jun 2020</em></h3>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>Writing custom RSpec matchers can be helpful for writing simpler, DRY-er and
      more descriptive specs. We&#39;ll talk about how they&#39;re used, how to make them,
      and some useful ones I&#39;ve discovered or created myself.<br></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>I live-coded this talk, and there was a great discussion afterwards where it
      was helpful having that coding environment available to show participants.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Service objects are an important tool in your Rails toolbox, and
      dry-transaction is one of the most powerful, and one of the most complicated.
      It&#39;s a &quot;business transaction&quot; DSL, and has error handling as a primary
      concern. This talk will give a background of how to use it, how to integrate
      it with your Rails application, and advanced usage with some custom steps.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I lament how difficult it is to build complicated nested form in
      Rails &amp; UJS. I offer a few solutions, including Form Objects. More recently,
      pure front-end apps in React or Ember have supplanted the need for a
      comprehensive solution in Rails itself.</p>

      <p>I describe several of the more powerful features provided by the HTTP protocol,
      which are supported by most basic HTTP clients in languages&#39; stdlib, but not
      taken advantage of by most advanced client libraries.</p>

      <p>As a member of the core team, I gave a tutorial on how to write custom adapters
      for the DataMapper ORM. Several adapters for other databases and web services
      were contributed as a result of this talk.</p>
